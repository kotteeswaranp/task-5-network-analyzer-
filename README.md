The provided Python code demonstrates a basic implementation of a network packet analyzer using the Scapy library. This packet analyzer captures and analyzes network traffic, providing insights into various aspects of the data being transmitted over the network.

At its core, the code utilizes Scapy's packet sniffing capabilities to intercept and examine network packets as they pass through the designated network interface. Upon capturing each packet, the analyzer extracts key information, including the source and destination IP addresses, protocol type, and packet size. This information serves as the basis for understanding the nature and characteristics of the network traffic.

The packet_handler function defines the logic for processing each captured packet. It checks if the packet contains Ethernet and IP layers, then extracts relevant details such as source and destination IP addresses, protocol, and packet size. This function acts as a callback and is invoked for every packet captured by Scapy's sniff function.

The sniff function initiates the packet capturing process, specifying the packet_handler function as the callback to be executed for each packet. In this example, it captures the next 10 packets on the network interface. However, this count can be adjusted to capture more or fewer packets as needed.

The output of the code consists of lines displaying the extracted information for each captured packet. Each line provides details such as the source and destination IP addresses, protocol (indicated by a numeric code where 6 represents TCP, for example), and the size of the packet in bytes. This output offers a snapshot of the network traffic traversing the interface during the execution of the packet analyzer.

Overall, while this code provides a simplistic illustration of packet analysis, it forms the foundation upon which more advanced functionality and features can be built. By extending the capabilities of this packet analyzer, one could develop more sophisticated network monitoring and security tools tailored to specific requirements.
